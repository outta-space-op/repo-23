# Introduction to Getting Remote Data

## Learning Goals

- Make requests to remote resources.
- Learn how to handle responses.
- Learn how to use JSON.

***

## Key Vocab

- **JSON**: JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format.
  that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of
  attribute–value pairs and arrays.
- **Endpoint**: An endpoint is one end of a communication channel.
- **API**: API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a
  software intermediary
 that allows two applications to talk to each other.

## Introduction

Applications often need to talk to one another. When you go to apply for a job,
sometimes you will see an option that allows you to import your profile from
LinkedIn. What’s happening here is the site you’re using is talking to LinkedIn,
and requesting some information. If you've ever seen a Google map inside of
another website or app such as Yelp — you're accessing remote data from a 3rd
party source.

This data can be very useful. You can pick and choose what parts of an
application you want to use without trawling through an entire codebase. You can
add a lot of interesting functionality into simple apps.

We'll discuss the answers to the following questions along the way:

- What is an API?
- How can APIs be used?
- How do you find the API endpoint?
- How do you send a request to an API?

In the next couple of lessons, we'll talk about leveraging remote data in our
applications.
